<p style="font-size: 2.5vh">
    The term tinkering was first used in 1300s to describe tinsmiths roaming around mending household gadgets. Lately,
    tinkering is interpreted as more as a perspective than a vocation.

<h2>Rethink! The Tinkering Lab at IIT Roorkee</h2>

<p style="font-size: 2.5vh">
    The Tinkering Lab at IIT Roorkee aims to balance the structured knowledge transfer to students in an externally controlled environment (classroom/laboratory sessions with a fixed mandate, pre-set time line, under the pressure of evaluation/judgement by others) with a space/platform equipped with some of the most emergent tools and technologies, that is confined by:
