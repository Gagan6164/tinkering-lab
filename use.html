                            <li>The timing of the Tinkering Laboratory is from 12 noon to 8 pm from Monday to Friday. Currently, the laboratory is operational for 5 days a week. There are few rules and regulations of the Tinkering Laboratory related to accessibility and usage.</li><br>

                           <li>The Lab is available for IIT Roorkee students and faculty members. Currently, we don’t have provision for outsiders to use this facility.</li><br>


                            <li>Biometric registration is compulsory for all the eligible users. The registration can be done by the tinkering lab staff on site during the office timings, for which the applicants need to carry Institute Identity card.</li><br>


                                Following the biometric registration, Lab accessibility is regulated at two levels, as below:<br><br>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Level I - Entry in to the common areas of the lab would be possible by thumb-impression verification on the biometric machine installed at the Lab entrance.</li>

                                    <li>Level II - Entry into the specialized-machine areas (Desktop 3D printers, Rapid Prototyping Machine and the CNCs) would be possible through card swipe on the biometric machines installed outside each machine equipped workspace.</li>

                                </ul><br>
                            <li>The power tools would be issued to the students on request for an estimated time, and such records would be maintained. A fine would be imposed on users if these tools are lost/misplaced/damaged by them.</li><br>


                            <li>Additional material required for carrying out a project would be issued to the students depending on the availability of inventory and the project work.</li><br>


                            <li>Use of aprons, gloves and other safety equipments are highly advisable. In case of any accident, students are strongly advised to use the first aid box, and to report the case immediately to the Institute Hospital and/or Security.</li><br>


                            <li>Tinkering Lab has an open space where the students can come for brainstorming and project discussions. Students’ are highly encouraged to work on their ideas to bring the technological revolution.</li><br>
